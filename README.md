<details>
<summary>Creating a soft link</summary>
After installing and extracting .tar.gz file in linux to run app anywhere in terminal we can create a softlink like this:

```$ ln -s /path/to/passlock/Passlock /usr/local/bin/passlock```

After this we can run passlock by typing `$ passlock`

</details>
<details>
<summary>Adding menu icon</summary>

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/applications
nano passlock.desktop
```

Paste the following lines by specifying the `/path/to/passlock` in `Exec` and `Icon` fields

```ini

### Issues

<summary>Linux</summary>

In linux you may face issues with app not starting, it's likely if `xrandr` isn't installed.

- Install `xrandr` by `$ sudo dnf xrandr` in fedora or `$ sudo apt xrandr` in ubuntu

</details>

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

- In MacOS after installing app you may face issues with app not starting, it's likely due to quarantine attribute set by MacOS.

```
